# Realtime Math

This library is geared towards realtime applications that require their math to be as fast as possible. Much care was taken to maximize inlining opportunities and for code generation to be optimal when a function isn't inlined by passing values in registers whenever possible. It contains 3D and 4D arithmetic commonly used in video games and realtime applications.

It offers an alternative to [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) and [DirectX Math](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXMath). See [here](https://nfrechette.github.io/2019/01/19/introducing_realtime_math/) for a comparison with similar libraries.

## Philosophy

Much thought was put into designing the library for it to be as flexible and powerful as possible. To this end, the following decisions were made:

*  The library consists of **100% C++11** header files and is thus easy to integrate in any project
*  The interface follows C-style conventions to ensure optimal code generation
*  Both *float32* and *float64* arithmetic are supported
*  Row vectors are used
*  See [here](./docs/api_conventions.md) for more details

## Supported platforms

*  Windows VS2015 x86 and x64
*  Windows (VS2017, VS2019) x86, x64, and ARM64
*  Windows VS2019 with clang9 x86 and x64
*  Linux (gcc 5 to 10) x86 and x64
*  Linux (clang 4 to 11) x86 and x64
*  OS X (Xcode 10.3) x86 and x64
*  OS X (Xcode 11.2) x64
*  Android (NDK 21) ARMv7-A and ARM64
*  iOS (Xcode 10.3, 11.2) ARM64
*  Emscripten (1.39.11) WASM

The above supported platform list is only what is tested every release but if it compiles, it should work just fine.

Note: *VS2017* and *VS2019* compile with *ARM64* on *AppVeyor* but I have no device to test them with.

## Getting started

This library is **100%** headers as such you just need to include them in your own project to start using it. However, if you wish to run the unit tests or to contribute to RTM head on over to the [getting started](./docs/getting_started.md) section in order to setup your environment and make sure to check out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## External dependencies

You don't need anything else to get started: everything is self contained.
See [here](./external) for details.
